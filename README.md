# Road Lane Line Detection from images and videos
Lane detetcion is a very common task performed by every human while driving. This is important to ensure there vehicles are within lane, so to make sure traffic is smooth and avoid collision with other vehicles.

Similarly, It is important in autonomous vehicles to detect lane lines.

The goal of this project is to create a pipeline to detect lane lines on the road.
